"""
This example demonstrates how to ask the same question to multiple different LLMs
and then combine their responses into a single coherent answer using another LLM.

The example uses three different models for answering:
- GPT-4O Mini
- Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Llama 3.3 70B

Then uses O3 Mini (with medium reasoning effort) to analyze and combine their responses.
