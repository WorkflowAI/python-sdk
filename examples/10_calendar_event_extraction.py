This example demonstrates how to create an agent that extracts calendar event information
from email content or images. It shows how to:
1. Parse email content to identify event details
2. Extract structured calendar information (date, time, location)
3. Handle different email formats and writing styles
4. Process event information from images (posters, flyers)
5. Return a well-structured calendar event object
