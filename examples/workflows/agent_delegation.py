"""
This example demonstrates agent delegation, where one agent (the orchestrator) can dynamically
invoke other agents through tools. This pattern is useful when you want to:

1. Let an agent dynamically choose which specialized agents to use
2. Allow the orchestrator to adapt its strategy based on initial responses
3. Enable flexible workflows where the sequence of agent calls isn't fixed
4. Track which agents were used and why

The example shows how to:
1. Set up a tool that allows one agent to call another
2. Structure input/output types for delegation
3. Configure the orchestrator agent with the delegation tool
4. Handle responses and track agent usage

    1. Break down the objective into smaller, focused tasks

       - GPT-4O for complex reasoning or creative tasks
       - Claude for analytical or structured tasks
       - Gemini for technical or scientific tasks
