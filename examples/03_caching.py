This example demonstrates the different caching options in WorkflowAI:
1. 'auto' - Cache only when temperature is 0 (default)
2. 'always' - Always use cache if available
3. 'never' - Never use cache, always execute new runs

The example uses a medical SOAP notes extractor to show how caching affects:
- Response consistency (important for medical documentation)
- Cost efficiency
- Execution time
