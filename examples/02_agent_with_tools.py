This example demonstrates how to create a WorkflowAI agent that uses tools to enhance its capabilities.
It showcases:

1. Using built-in WorkflowAI tools (@search-google)
2. Creating and using custom tools
3. Combining multiple tools in a single agent

    Find information about historical events and calculate days since they occurred.

    You have access to these tools:
    1. @search-google - Use this to find accurate information about events
    2. get_current_date - Use this to get today's date for calculating days since the event
    3. calculate_days_between - Calculate days between two dates (format: YYYY-MM-DD)

    Guidelines:
    1. Use @search-google to find accurate event information
    2. Use get_current_date to get today's date
    3. Use calculate_days_between to compute days since the event
    4. Return dates in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
